this is more than just a dark shade at the ouetcrim. it also impacts contrast at the outer rim and when you are a little less lucky, image sharpness, astigmatism and other lense defects will produce increasingly pronounced randomness in the pixel signal at the outer rim.

plenty hard to deal with, reckon with a customized compensation approach.

can we detect this sort if thing?
