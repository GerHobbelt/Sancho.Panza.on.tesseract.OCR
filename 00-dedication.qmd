dedicated to Henk (footnote: IPA/English pronunciation Hank)

for having persevered in attempting to educate me in your inimitable way, for having done most of the legwork and making the tough and painful choices (Charlie, Scent of a Woman) that have enabled me to develop some souvereign thought (footnote about philosophy and footnote about the souvereign loonies: it ain't the same thing).
Yes, you were correct. It took me several decades, regrettably, to come to concur 100% with your position and argument instead of wanting to at least partially disagree. Control engineering is indeed everywhere and exercising a fundamental principle. Neglecting this or otherwise wishing to ignore this is wilful stupidity a.k.a. living in LaLa Land, telling yourself the capital lie that reality is less important than your precious idea / thought model aka your belief system. (footnote about math lovers and CS, the only technology oriented line of education which does not include control engineering as part of its curriculum, which is IMO the root cause why it is the most bizarrely hype-infested and -sensitive profession of the whole STEM bunch.

My recalcitrant part desired to, if ever so slightly, *disagree*, to differ and hope to one day declare that *improvement*. Now *that* was fallacy if there ever was one.

While I always wholeheartedly embraced your notion about *(thought) models* and their serving us (instead of the other way around) and their inherent need to be adaptable and disposable (for models have a survivability rate similar to battle plans cf. Von Clausewitz), it might interest you, posthumously alas, that this century's IT/CS reli-nuts would most probably wish to claim this *agile*. On a positive note however, my dearest dad, may I suggest you & I use the new Truss[^1] unit of measure re model applicability over time, i.e. survivability? It's been too long since I saw you do a no-hands facepalm.

^1: of course, if you are writing a paper on Quantum Effects In Politics, you'd be better off using the Scaramucci unit of measure instead, for nobody likes to read through dreadfully long series of significant zeroes in your reporting.
