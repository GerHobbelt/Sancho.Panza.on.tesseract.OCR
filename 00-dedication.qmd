dedicated to Henk (footnote: IPA/English pronunciation Hank)

for having persevered in attempting to educate me, for having done most of the legwork and making the tough and painful choices (Charlie, Scent of a Woman) that have enabled me to develop souvereign thought (footnote about philosophy and footnote about the souvereign loonies: it ain't the same thing).
Yes, you were correct. It took me several decades, regrettably, to come to concur 100% with your position and argument instead of wanting to at least partially disagree. Control engineering is indeed everywhere and a fundamental principle. Neglecting this or otherwise wishing to ignore this is wilful stupidity a.k.a. living in lala land, telling yourself the capital lie that reality is less important than your precious idea / thought model aka your belief system. (footnote about math lovers and CS, the only technology oriented line of education which does not include control engineering as part of its curriculum, which is IMO the root cause why it is the most bizarrely hype-infested and -sensitive profession of the whole STEM bunch.
