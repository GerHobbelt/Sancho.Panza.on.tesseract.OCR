while the tech savvy among us will know the difference between lossy and lossless image file formats, or rather: lossy/perceptual and lossless image compression formats, usually it's not a big enough issue to really care.

however, when the image will end up at the doorstep if an ice image-to-text engine, this suddenly becomes a most serious import: while those lossy compression formats are designed to produce images at small storage cost and negligible-for-us-humans differences versus the original snapshot, it turns out these neural networks, AI and OCR engine magical machines are far from human perception equivalent: we will observe a couple of adversarial input images being processed along the way -- adversarial meaning they sport artifacts that throw a machine off its game, while the crazed machine response will seem very much unreasonable to us humans, hence the surprise attack these produce -- but first we'll have a deep, intense, look at what lossy (jpeg) compression produces in our images. as we'll exaggerate the generated artifacts, it should become blatantly clear why experts all around strongly advise against using these image formats when feeding an ice engine.


however, sometimes there's no choice, possibly because your camera has hardwired mpeg/jpeg/h246/... compression built in, making every image / snapshot automatically a lossy one, or you are required to process images from sources outside your area if control and thus lossy formats slithering through the entrance gates, or you simply cannot afford the increased costs in storage and/or compression time for same-size lossless image alternatives. irrespective the cause, some times real life hands you lemons and we still don't want lemonade, so something gotta budge.

first, let's put a lossy format image of high quality under the microscope. then we'll also disect a low quality i.e. high compression a.k.a. low quality lossy format image to see what gives when we push the artifacts to boldly show up fir our human eyeball Mk. I: no more "perceptually indistinguishable" here!
