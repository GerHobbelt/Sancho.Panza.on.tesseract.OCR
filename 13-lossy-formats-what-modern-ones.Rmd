What about those new file formats. We've been bashing jpeg for long enough, surely webp, jpegxl, avif, etc must be miles ahead by now and not suffering from such aggravating artifacts?

bzzzt! wrong! while they may suffer from these "compression artifacts" a little less, these still persist. heck, it's an obvious corollary if the term "lossy compression" anyhow, or did you dream it would just smooth the image to eternal beauty like granny playing with her insta anti-aging make,-up filters enjoying a wrinkle-free experience at her centenarian festival? dream in, buddy, it rather: hand me the phone number of your pharmacist right quick as I'ld love to experience that level if bliss too before I cross the twilight of my life!

here's webp, jpegxl, avif and others, all blown up and out if proportion for your enjoyment.

to keep things professional and equanimous, we'll put a couple of good quality jpeg blowups next to them so you can compare notes on the scoring, but be aware and stay aware: lossy file formats and plain or hidden lossy compression stages in your sourced image pipeline (remember those cameras I mentioned with mpeg/jpeg/h264/h265 hardwired in he chips!) will add to your headaches when doing OCR. oh, and why is this less if an issue, if any at all, for the bonanza in facial recognition software? well, my bet is their models have much less to do, but I expect noisy input like that can throw a spanner in the works when you need to differentiate between siblings or are otherwise taxed to produce a sure-fire, above 95% confidence match from a catalog if several thousand individuals (what would then be your alphabet that needs recognizing); from what I've seen in passing, those confidence metrics are severely dented then and pretty mediocre compared to the high 90-ies numbers we desire for an ice job well done! plus, with recognizing humans, there's the extra of video input, where gait and other (motion) aspects are taken into account to find out who you are. regrettably there's no such luck with OCR: you'll need a serious dose of class A restricted hallucinogens before those printed characters will start to move and dance . still, even then, the machine gets left behind as it cannot experience the "gait" if a printed character, only you can, with a lot if help from your pharmaceutical friend. So wouldn't you agree it might be safe to argue OCR engines have a generally more difficult pattern recognition/matching task than video surveillance CCTV, thanks to far fewer input features and no escape route via video inspection rather than still image evaluation only. life is a bitch, indeed
